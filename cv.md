## About Me
I am a third-year student at the Faculty of Software Engineering. I enjoy learning about technology and creating new things with code. During my studies, I became very interested in front-end development. I like making websites look good and work well.

Before this, I also tried working as a motion designer with 2D animation. It was a fun and creative experience. Now, I am studying at RS School to become a front-end developer. I want to grow my skills and work on real projects in the future.
